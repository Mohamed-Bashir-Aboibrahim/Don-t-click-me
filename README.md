## Welcome to the Most Tempting Button on the Internet!

You’ve found **DON’T CLICK ME!** – a single-button web experience that will test your self-control, curiosity, and maybe even your sanity. It looks simple, but every click takes you deeper into a wild world of chaos, color, and surprises. **You’ve been warned!**

---

## 🌟 How to Play

1. **Open `index.html`** in your browser.
2. **See that big red button?**  
   It literally says: “DON’T CLICK ME!”
3. **Whatever you do...**
   - Seriously, don’t click it.
   - Really.  
   - ...But you’re going to, aren’t you?  
4. **Each click** brings a new, unpredictable effect. Some are beautiful, some are weird, some are just plain ridiculous. No two runs will feel the same!

## 🕹️ Features

- 🚀 **10+ Wild Visual Effects**  
  From rainbow explosions and earthquakes to emoji apocalypses, clones, disco parties, and more. Every click triggers something unexpected.

- 🧠 **The Button Learns**  
  It remembers which effects you’ve seen and won’t repeat until you’ve experienced them all.

- 🔐 **A SECRET FINAL STAGE**  
  Are you persistent enough to unlock the ultimate secret? There’s something special waiting if you manage to trigger every effect...

## ❓ The Final Secret Stage

**Once you’ve discovered every single effect, the button unleashes the ULTIMATE SECRET:**

- The world transforms into a celebration just for you!  
- **Particle explosions, confetti showers, floating emojis, and a glowing congratulations** take over the screen.
- The button itself changes—maybe it’s not the end after all?  
- **You’ve unlocked a spectacle that only the most stubborn (or curious) will ever see.**

Give yourself a pat on the back… and maybe a break from clicking for a while.  
*(But is it really the end? Only one way to find out…)*
